But many worry that the formal equality of law creates substantive inequalities in a world in which people have different capacities, endowments, and fundamental interests. This is a theoretical problem at the heart of liberal democracy. The rule of law is ordinarily understood to be a basic condition for the legitimacy of (small-l) liberal states. Its demands are expressed in provisions of the U.S. constitution like the due process and equal protection clauses. And its ideals are deeply embedded in the Anglo-American legal tradition, in Magna Carta as well as the principles of the common law. If, as some scholars have argued, there's something hostile to genuine equality in the rule of law, then that hostility is at the heart of our constitutional order. <br><br>I aim to relieve some worries about this putative hostility. The paper carries out three tasks. 1) It clarifies what it takes for the state to satisfy the rule of law demand that the laws must be general. 2) It shows that the evaluation of whether a society comports with the rule of law does not depend solely on facts about the legal system, but also on a host of other non-legal social facts, particularly, the extent to which some members of society are the victims of (non-legal) injustice. And, 3) it shows that the rule of law generates a critique of economic injustice. It follows that the traditional association of the rule of law with the political right, and its critique from the left, are misguided. <br><br>Ultimately, the paper reinterprets the notion of general law as an expressive ideal, meant to protect the equal status of the members of a political community. It gives an account of the vexed question of how the expressive meaning of a law may be found.

I show that arguments to the contrary mostly represent an unduly narrow conception of what might count as law in Athens, one that inappropriately excludes common-knowledge social customs.<br><br>Second, Athenians saw the rule of law as serving the equality of mass and elite, oligarchs and democrats: there was no contradiction (again contra some classicists) between the democratic power of the masses and the rule of law. This equality consisted in two topoi frequently deployed in the Athenian legal and social discourse. First is the respect topos, according to which the laws represent respect for the democratic polis. To disregard them is to reveal one's lack of respect for the polis and one's oligarchic character. Second is the strength topos, according to which the laws are the way that the democratic polis exercises its power: weak members of the masses cannot stand up to strong members of the elite alone, they need the backing of the whole community, and that backing is coordinated through the law; to undermine the law is thereby to undermine the political power of the masses.<br><br>Third, this connection between equality and the rule of law explains the most striking fact about Athenian legality, to wit, the otherwise puzzling effectiveness of the amnesty enacted for crimes committed under the Thirty Tyrants. The strength topos explains why the democrats in Athens refrained from avenging themselves against the Thirty despite their opportunity to do so: by doing so, they would have undermined the law, and thereby their own equality.

The second section offers an argument against the respect complaint, centered on the notion that courts express rather than override popular legal judgments. The third section draws on the second to argue that 'weak judicial review systems,' in which legislatures may override constitutional rulings, function the same way as 'strong judicial review systems,' such as the U.S., in virtue of the fact that the courts in each system can wield power over legislatures only to the extent they can generally recruit popular support. In light of the empirical fact that the extent to which legislatures defer to constitutional courts varies widely in weak judicial review systems, I conclude that the question of the relationship between judicial review and democracy is really a far more fine-grained problem of institutional design, not the simple binary choice to have or not have what critics of the U.S. system have misguidedly named 'judicial supremacy.'", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "33 ", "altlink": "http://paul-gowder.com/cmc-paper.pdf", "firstpage": "7", "coauthor": null, "book": null, "publisher": null, "year": "2014", "editor": null, "title": "The Countermajoritarian Complaint", "publink": null, "type": "law review", "journal": "Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems", "note": "(invited contribution)"}, {"issue": "9", "abstract": null, "volume": "115", "lastpage": "2278", "altlink": null, "firstpage": "2254", "coauthor": "K.A.D.
