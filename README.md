This is just an effort to fix the horrible spaghetti code that makes up my personal website.  probably nothing of use to anyone else.  Ignore me.  

(todo: 

1.  fix the html cv to be template based (DONE)
2.  extend template to markdown --> pdf, docx
3.  extend template to main site, get rid of stupid ajax call 
4.  then set up a ring/luminous or flask server plus remote build with fabric etc and github.

)
