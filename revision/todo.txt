1.  Fix cv component: right now a bunch of data doesn't show up, but no errors---so I think I'm just getting the data shape wrong after all the changes to underlying files.

1.5. Move photo into nav/home component.

2.  Fix pubs: it doesn't have its own component file yet, it's sitting around in obsolete land.

3.  Get rid of old garbage code, there's huge amounts of it from pre-refactor-into-components.

4.  Finish navigation and building out components for other pages.

5.  Get content for media and such, and generally finalize page choice.

6.  Style it.
